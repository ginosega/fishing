# Fishing Project — active work queue

**Authority:** Canonical active state is `governance/project-ops`; default `main` `PROJECT_ROUTER.md` and `NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md` are static entry points. [Operating rules](OPERATING_RULES.md) apply to subsequent work.

## FISH-OPS-V2 — Operating Model v2 adoption

State: closed
Owner: project owner; assistant implementation
Next safe action: Routine in-place upkeep only, through protected governance PRs; do not reopen migration solely because PWA app development resumes.
Prerequisites: P1 design approval and independence amendment; completed P2, P3, P4 and P5 evidence.
Acceptance: Five bounded current documents, permanent static transfer prompt/router, indexed accepted/rejected/deferred/superseded lessons and original sources, no duplicate active authority; owner-approved full adoption.
Evidence: [Owner directive](P5_OWNER_DIRECTIVE_COMPLETE_GOVERNANCE_2026-11-01.md), [P4 acceptance](P4_RECOVERY_ACCEPTANCE_2026-11-01.md), [main router PR #292](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/pull/292), [ruleset #26335925](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/rules/26335925).

## FISH-OPS-V2-VALIDATION — Required independent structural checks

State: closed
Owner: assistant implementer; project owner configured protected branch
Next safe action: Maintain validator and fixture checks through review/required CI on canonical governance branch; keep PWA release safeguards separate.
Prerequisites: `governance-docs` on `governance/project-ops`, required `fishing-merge-ready`, strict up-to-date status rules.
Acceptance: Valid governance PR PASS; invalid missing link FAIL; non-draft failing PR's GitHub merge state blocked; entire working corpus and ancillary docs covered; deleting all active docs no longer bypasses validator.
Evidence: [Issue #284](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/issues/284), [ruleset](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/rules/26335925), [negative block PR #296](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/pull/296), [hardening PR #297](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/pull/297).

## FISH-OPS-V2-RECOVERY — Bounded new-chat transfer

State: closed
Owner: assistant for ongoing maintenance; project owner accepted P4 field recovery
Next safe action: For normal handoff repeat exact unchanged fenced static prompt; for emergency recover it from default main and recheck router/refs.
Prerequisites: [P4 field evidence](P4_RECOVERY_ACCEPTANCE_2026-11-01.md) and active main router.
Acceptance: Both normal and emergency new-chat recoveries passed, including prior rejected alternatives and safe handling of unknown provider/publishing state.
Evidence: [P4 acceptance](P4_RECOVERY_ACCEPTANCE_2026-11-01.md), [static prompt](../../NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md).

## FISH-TODO-118 — Fishing Companion V3 continuation

State: ready
Owner: project owner / assistant implementer
Next safe action: Verify live V3 source PR/branch/CI and separate private Worker/owner field state; resolve Gear Notes image and failed Catch publication safely before additional V3 changes. Consult indexed decisions for rejected attestor and wholesale prototype merge.
Prerequisites: Operating Model v2 adoption complete; original V3 security/requirements/experimental build approvals remain controlling. No new public cutover approval inferred.
Acceptance: Complete remaining scoped D1–D6 functional/security/performance/hosted and owner acceptance tests; explicit separate public V3 cutover gate.
Evidence: [V3 draft #263](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/pull/263), [requirements](../../pwa/docs/Fishing_Companion_v3_Requirements.md), [Playwright issue #287](https://github.com/ginosega/fishing/issues/287).

## Independent fishing equipment and editorial backlog

Open, closed and explicitly deleted personal fishing/gear/KB tasks remain discoverable at [FISHING_BACKLOG_INDEX.md](FISHING_BACKLOG_INDEX.md); do not absorb into V3 milestones or reopen silently.
