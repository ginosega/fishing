# Fishing TODO

_Last reconciled: 2026-09-09 (Pacific time)._

This is the canonical backlog. Current facts live in structured source and authored Markdown; historical task descriptions, completed release details and prior versions remain in Git/History. Statuses: OPEN, WAITING ON USER, IN PROGRESS, DEFERRED, DONE, SUPERSEDED. P1 is necessary for the approved core/data integrity; P2 is useful but not required at launch; P3 is optional. Do not infer purchases, ownership or historical Catch attribution.

## V2 project

The approved requirements and fourteen decisions are complete. The implementation and pinned migration are committed on the isolated feature branch; browser/offline acceptance is not complete and no v2 preview has been published. The pinned migration is complete, but its known media exceptions and production-current source reconciliation remain separate gates. The exact continuation and evidence are in `Fishing_v2_Work_Handoff_2026-09-09.md`. P2 is not authorized by the temporary Work switch.

| ID | Priority | Status | Work item / next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| FISH-TODO-071 | P1 | DONE | Reconcile the approved Inventory and fourteen Design Review decisions into the authoritative baseline. Preserve original responses. PR 62. |
| FISH-TODO-072 | P1 | DONE | Complete the pinned source/dependency/data/media audit and minimal technical contracts. Source and verified-build evidence retained; browser/device gates tracked separately. |
| FISH-TODO-073 | P1 | IN PROGRESS | Implement the minimal v2 architecture. Core runtime, independent domains, editors, lockfile, builder, migration and initial test suite are committed in draft PR 64. Complete remaining implementation defects and acceptance; do not restart the vertical slice. |
| FISH-TODO-074 | P1 | DONE | Pinned one-time migration completed at `6615ae7296e48d90dceab303b6b5a1fbc041ab80`, run 34328748390 success. Gear 66 → 69, KB 54, Catches 5, exact narrative preservation, 49 approved image adoptions and machine reconciliation. Remaining media exceptions are 078; any required current-main source refresh is part of 076. Do not rerun the original migration. |
| FISH-TODO-075 | P1 | IN PROGRESS | Complete P1 browsing, source-aware Gear/KB handoffs, viewer, full-library offline reading and browser acceptance. Core 15/15 pass; first hosted browser run 34330339245 passed 2/6. Resolve 081, test update/rollback/corruption/dirty-form behavior, and verify supported-browser/mobile acceptance. |
| FISH-TODO-076 | P1 | OPEN | Publish and verify isolated `/fishing/v2-preview/` without changing v1 root; reconcile actual current main and source; obtain user preview acceptance. Only after separate cutover approval complete production integration, rollback checkpoint, actual hosted verification and obsolete-v1 cleanup. Consolidate temporary migration/workspace/acceptance workflows into the normal release path at the appropriate stage. |
| FISH-TODO-077 | P2 | DEFERRED | Direct Save/authentication, integrated uploads, Catch browser authoring and offline editing/outbox/sync require separate approval. No P2 infrastructure in P1. |
| FISH-TODO-078 | P1 | OPEN | Media: 49 approved captures adopted, 2 rejected. Resolve seven required items (Tsuridamashii, Rapala F-3, Perch, Popper, Whopper Plopper KB pictures, Mack's Pee Wee Hoochie, River2Sea Whopper Plopper 60). Generic inline-spinner picture is optional. Correct Rapala's erroneous optional flag and enforce required-media accounting. No automatic acquisition, invented replacements or silent deletion. |
| FISH-TODO-079 | P1 | DONE | User accepted source equivalence and waived a separate device-only IndexedDB export for the pinned migration. No device inspection is claimed. Preserve old stores and reconcile any later-discovered local-only data before retirement. |
| FISH-TODO-080 | P1 | DONE | Reconcile current project records, decisions, TODO, source/technical addenda and bootstrap for temporary Work handoff. Preserve original requirements and complete a cross-file consistency audit. Details in the dated Work Handoff. |
| FISH-TODO-081 | P1 | IN PROGRESS | Resolve browser acceptance failures: accessible viewer controls/precise selectors; editor heading ambiguity; successful upgrade selecting the new complete release; retry/repair after corrupt cached content. Add regression coverage for pinned release identity, failure recovery and no code/data mixing. Rerun full hosted gate without weakening assertions. |
| FISH-TODO-063 | P2 | SUPERSEDED | Historical v1 KB filename/upload usability issue. V2 approved filename/authoring model replaces old ID-prefix/source-owner requirements; preserve v1 behavior until cutover. |
| FISH-TODO-039 | P2 | SUPERSEDED | Historical structured setup recording on catches. V2 removes setup references; equipment details belong in Catch Notes. |

## Historical completion and release references

FISH069/070 were completed in PR 60; FISH068 in PR 58; FISH067 in PR 57; FISH064–066 in PR 54/56; FISH062 in PR 52; FISH061 in PR 50; FISH060 in PR 48/49; FISH058 in PR 47; FISH059 was the Cylinder Weights media release. Complete evidence and the earlier completed-task table are preserved in Git history, `History/2026-09-07-pre-recovery/Fishing_TODO.md` and the dated release files. The historical duplicate FISH060 handoff ID remains retired as `ARCHIVE-2026-09-06-HANDOFF`. The next unused canonical task ID is FISH-TODO-082. No completed task has been reopened or discarded by this reconciliation.
